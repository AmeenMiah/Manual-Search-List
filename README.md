# Manual-Input-Search

 This tool is great for revision. You can perform depth-first search, breadth-first search, uniform-cost search, a* search, and best first greedy search. This tool will not perform the search outright, you will need to do a lot manual input so it isn't great to check answers but rather to type out searches for revisions.
